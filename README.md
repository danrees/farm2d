# Farming 2D Game Demo

This is an experimental repo for me to figure out how I want to do various systems for a farming/life
sim/RPG type game.

I will put more documentation and/or sub documents to explain things as this comes together however this is all
very rough so far and very likely to change repeatedly.

## Systems

### Components System

Trying to create components that can be attached to entities to add behaviours

see [/components/entities]

### Water Effects

Contains a visual water shader attempting to get a water effect I like

see [/test_scenes/water_test] for the various attempts taken from various youtube/internet tutorials and tweaked to my liking

### Tile Maps

Contains my experiments getting the TileMapLayer and Terrain systems to my liking.

see [test_scenes/farming_test] for the latest experiments here

### Inventory System

Attempts to get an inventory system as well as UI components for it

see [components/inventory] for these files.
